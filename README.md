# CCNA_Task
Task list to make your networking concepts strong

[Day 1 task](Day_1/Day_1.md): After completing this task you will get to know how the IP addresses are formed and the sequence of IP addresses.

[Day 2 task](Day_2/Day_2.md): This task will teach you the subnet mask conversions, IP address calculations, and network range determination based on the provided IP addresses and subnet masks.

[Day 3 task](Day_3/Day_3.md): This task involves analyzing Class C IP addresses with different subnet masks to calculate network details such as NID, BIP, number of networks (N+), and IPs per network (N+).

[Day 4 task](Day_4/Day_4.md): This task involves subnet analysis using CIDR notation for specific Class A and Class B IP addresses, calculating subnet masks, NID, BIP, number of networks (N+), and IPs per network (N+).
