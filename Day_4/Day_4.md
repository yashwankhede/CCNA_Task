### Subnet Analysis Task with Class A and Class B IP Addresses

**Objective:**
Perform subnet analysis for Class A and Class B IP addresses using CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). Generate specific IP addresses within these classes and analyze subnetting with varying CIDR prefixes.

**IP Addresses for Analysis:**

1.  IP Address: `9.230.120.10/15`
2.  IP Address: `10.100.102.0/3`
3.  IP Address: `10.240.76.0/7`
4.  IP Address: `172.216.54.0/9`
5.  IP Address: `172.47.23.0/12`
6.  IP Address: `172.98.89.0/14`
7.  IP Address: `45.124.235.12/5`
8.  IP Address: `192.200.123.12/2`
9.  IP Address: `12.100.200.45/28`
10. IP Address: `26.36.46.56/19`

**Steps to Perform:**
1. Calculate the netowrk number to which the IP address belongs to.
2. Write down the NID and BIP for that N+.

**Output should looks like:**

IP Address: 192.168.1.2/25

Network: 2nd N+

NID    : 192.168.1.128

BIP    : 192.168.1.255
