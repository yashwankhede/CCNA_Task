### Subnet Analysis Task

**Objective:**
Perform subnet analysis for each provided IP address and its subnet mask. This includes converting the subnet mask into binary representation, calculating the total number of IP addresses in a network, determining the number of networks based on the subnet mask, and identifying the range of each network (Network ID - NID and Broadcast IP - BIP).

**IP Addresses for Analysis:**

1. **IP Address 1:**
   - IP Address: `128.168.1.240`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.240`

2. **IP Address 2:**
   - IP Address: `192.111.145.56`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.128`

3. **IP Address 3:**
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.128`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.224`

4. **IP Address 4:**
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.128`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.192`

5. **IP Address 5:**
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.128`
   - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.240`

**Steps to Perform:**
1. Convert each subnet mask into its binary representation.
2. Calculate the total number of IP addresses in each network using the subnet mask.
3. Determine the number of networks based on the subnet mask.
4. Identify and display the range of each network:
   - List the first and last IP addresses (Network ID - NID and Broadcast IP - BIP) for the provided IP address.
